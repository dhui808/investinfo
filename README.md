# InvestInfo
This Java application helps professional Forex/Commodity traders to track and analyze the trend of Forex/Commodity Futures products.

It does so by linking the weekly close prices/indices of CFDs (currenly from www.investing.com) with the position data for Tuesday, which is released every Friday by
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) (www.cftc.gov).
